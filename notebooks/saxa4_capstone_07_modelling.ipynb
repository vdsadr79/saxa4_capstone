— Logistic Regression Baseline\n","\n","### 1. Strong Overall Model Performance\n","The TF-IDF + Logistic Regression baseline performed **better than expected** for a 4-class, highly imbalanced NLP classification task.  \n","Key metrics:\n","- **Macro F1:** 0.676  \n","- **Macro Recall:** 0.654  \n","- **Accuracy:** 0.964  \n","\n","Given the extreme imbalance in the dataset, these scores confirm that the model is learning meaningful patterns beyond simply predicting the majority class.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. Excellent Classification for Three Out of Four Classes\n","The model demonstrates strong ability to distinguish between dominant and moderately represented classes:\n","\n","| Class | Precision | Recall | F1 |\n","|-------|-----------|---------|--------|\n","| **Neither** | 0.972 | 1.000 | 0.986 |\n","| **Both** | 0.955 | 0.840 | 0.894 |\n","| **Rights** | 0.875 | 0.778 | 0.824 |\n","\n","These results indicate:\n","- **Clear separation** between “Both” vs “Neither”\n","- **Meaningful signal** in the narrative text for the “Rights-impacting” class  \n","- High reliability when classifying dominant and mid-frequency categories\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. Underperformance on “Safety” Class Due to Data Scarcity\n","The **Safety** class contains only **16 total examples** in the entire dataset  \n","(3 examples in the test set).\n","\n","As a result:\n","- Model recall for “Safety” is **0.0**\n","- This reflects a **data limitation**, not a model limitation\n","\n","Low-sample classes typically require:\n","- Oversampling / synthetic examples  \n","- Class-balanced training  \n","- More expressive models (e.g., ANN)\n","\n","This will be addressed in the next modelling stage.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4. Class Balancing Significantly Improved Minority Class Performance\n","Using `class_weight=\"balanced\"`:\n","- Markedly improved performance for **Rights** and **Both**\n","- Prevented the model from defaulting to “Neither”\n","- Allowed meaningful learning despite heavy skew\n","\n","This suggests balancing strategies will be equally important for ANN.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 5. TF-IDF (1–2 gram) Representation Is Effective\n","The earlier sandbox experiments identified that:\n","- **Word-level TF-IDF (1–2 grams)**  \n","- With sublinear TF, English stopwords, and mild frequency filtering  \n","\n","produces the most stable and accurate performance.\n","\n","This reinforces that **narrative text in the Federal AI Use Case Inventory carries strong signal** for predicting impact type.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 6. This Baseline Provides a Strong Foundation for ANN\n","The model:\n","- Separates Rights, Both, and Neither very well  \n","- Fails only in the Safety class due to data scarcity  \n","- Provides interpretable weights for explainability  \n","- Establishes a strong numerical baseline for ANN comparison  \n","\n","Next, an ANN can model nonlinear patterns and may recover additional structure for minority classes.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Summary**\n","The Logistic Regression baseline is **strong, reliable, interpretable, and suitable** as the foundational model for the capstone. Despite data limitations in the smallest class (Safety), the model extracts meaningful signals from text and correctly identifies Rights-impacting and Both-impacting cases at high rates.

Overall Performance Is Strong and Comparable to Logistic Regression\n","The ANN achieved:\n","- **Accuracy:** 0.955  \n","- **Macro F1:** 0.668  \n","- **Macro Recall:** 0.670  \n","\n","This is nearly identical to the Logistic Regression baseline  \n","(macro F1 = 0.676, macro recall = 0.654).  \n","This tells us that **non-linear modeling via ANN does not dramatically improve performance** on this dataset, given the text’s structure and the limited size of minority classes.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. Improved Recall for the “Both” Class\n","The ANN performs especially well on the **Both-impacting** class:\n","- F1 = 0.868  \n","- Recall = 0.920  \n","\n","Compared to Logistic Regression (recall = 0.840), the ANN captures more dual-impact patterns.  \n","This suggests the ANN is slightly more flexible when handling mixed governance signals.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. “Rights” Class Performance Remains Strong and Stable\n","Performance on **Rights-impacting** use cases is almost identical to the Logistic model:\n","- F1 = 0.824  \n","- Recall = 0.778  \n","\n","This shows the narrative text contains **clear linguistic cues** related to rights-impacting concerns, and both models learn these consistently.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4. “Safety” Class Remains Challenging Due to Data Scarcity\n","Both models struggle to predict the **Safety** class:\n","- Only **16 total safety examples** in the dataset  \n","- Only **3 safety examples** appear in the test set  \n","- ANN recall = 0.0 (same as Logistic)\n","\n","This is a **data limitation, not a model limitation**.  \n","Even with oversampling and ANN flexibility, there is not enough data to learn reliable patterns for Safety.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 5. Oversampling Successfully Balanced the Training Set\n","Because `MLPClassifier` does not support `sample_weight` in this sklearn version:\n","- The minority classes were **oversampled** to match the majority class.\n","- This produced a clean, balanced training set.\n","- ANN trained stably without introducing new bias.\n","\n","Oversampling was a valid and effective strategy for handling class imbalance.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 6. ANN and Logistic Regression Tell the Same Overall Story\n","Across all metrics and confusion matrices, the ANN:\n","- Tracks the Logistic model closely  \n","- Delivers small gains in “Both”  \n","- Matches performance in “Rights”  \n","- Struggles equally with “Safety”  \n","- Maintains high precision and recall for “Neither”\n","\n","This suggests that the **text signal is largely linear**, and ANN does not uncover stronger nonlinear relationships.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Summary**\n","The ANN provides a meaningful comparison to the Logistic Regression baseline.  \n","Although it does not significantly outperform Logistic Regression, it validates that:\n","\n","1. TF-IDF captures most of the available predictive signal  \n","2. Minority class difficulty (especially “Safety”) is caused by **low sample size**, not model choice  \n","3. ANN introduces mild improvements for “Both-impacting” cases  \n","4. Logistic Regression remains the most interpretable and efficient model  \n","5. ANN supports the conclusion that **governance impact classification from narrative text is learnable but limited by class imbalance**\n","\n","This ANN serves as a strong secondary model and helps

Key Findings\n","\n","### 1. Overall Performance Is Strong and Consistent With Other Models\n","The SVM achieved:\n","- **Accuracy:** 0.955  \n","- **Macro F1:** 0.635  \n","- **Macro Recall:** 0.599  \n","\n","This places the SVM very close to the Logistic Regression (macro F1 = 0.676)  \n","and slightly below the ANN (macro F1 = 0.668).  \n","This consistency shows that all three models learn the same underlying text signal.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. Excellent Performance on “Both” and “Neither”\n","The SVM continues the trend seen with Logistic and ANN:\n","- **Both-impacting:** F1 = 0.894 (very strong)  \n","- **Neither:** F1 = 0.981 (perfect recall, high precision)\n","\n","This confirms that the narrative text for these classes carries clear, consistent signals that all models can learn.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. “Rights” Class Performance Slightly Lower Than Logistic/ANN\n","The SVM achieved:\n","- **Rights:** Precision 0.833, Recall 0.556, F1 0.667\n","\n","This is slightly below:\n","- Logistic (F1 = 0.824)  \n","- ANN (F1 = 0.824)\n","\n","The confusion matrix shows the model misclassifies some rights-impacting cases as “neither.”  \n","This suggests that SVM is somewhat more conservative in assigning minority classes.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4. “Safety” Class Still Not Learned (Expected Dataset Limitation)\n","As with Logistic and ANN, the SVM achieves:\n","- **Safety:** Precision = 0.0, Recall = 0.0\n","\n","This is expected because:\n","- The dataset contains **only 16 total safety examples**\n","- Only **3 safety samples** appear in the test set  \n","\n","No model (linear or nonlinear) can learn a class with such limited representation.  \n","This is a **data limitation**, not a model failure.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 5. Misclassification Patterns Are Consistent Across All Models\n","The confusion matrix shows:\n","- Some “both” predicted as “neither”  \n","- Some “rights” predicted as “neither”  \n","- “Safety” mostly predicted as “neither” or “both”\n","\n","These patterns are almost identical to Logistic and ANN.  \n","This triangulates the finding that model choices do not meaningfully change the results — the dataset structure drives the performance limits.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 6. SVM Adds Strength to the Model Comparison Story\n","The SVM confirms:\n","- Linear text-based models (Logistic, SVM) largely extract the same signal\n","- ANN does not uncover substantially more nonlinear structure\n","- Performance on minority classes (especially “rights”) is stable across models\n","- “Safety” remains challenging due to sample scarcity, not algorithm design\n","\n","This makes the model comparison section robust and well-justified.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Summary**\n","The SVM provides a fast, strong, and stable third model that closely matches performance from Logistic Regression and ANN. Together, the three models triangulate the same conclusion:\n","\n","- **Impact-type classification from narrative text is highly feasible for “neither”, “both”, and “rights.”**  \n","- **“Safety” performance is limited by extremely low sample size rather than model capability.**  \n","- **Across all three models, the overall signal is consistent and reliable**, supporting the strength of the baseline and the broader modeling approach.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"7436e1a7-0637-45e8-98b2-a347101f5845","metadata":{"id":"7436e1a7-0637-45e8-98b2-a347101f5845"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.3"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
